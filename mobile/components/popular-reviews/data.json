    "text": "Thoroughly cool and badass — there are few action directors who could match Miller working at 75 percent — but also a bit bloated and uneven. Some relatively simple segments are drawn out for too long, and then key narrative beats and character arcs are skimped over. I found the pacing to be a bit baffling, I must say; often killed the momentum for me.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with the Bible-like, episodic structure, which I thought was a great way to tell an entirely different type of story and distance the movie from cheap Fury Road comparisons. It just feels two cuts away from excellence.",

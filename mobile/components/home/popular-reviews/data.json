    "text": "Terrific. It is at once a nostalgic throwback to the classic Godzilla movies, while also feeling like a radical reinvention of the entire franchise. Godzilla as a metaphor has never been more eloquently handled, and the film's messages about war, peace, guilt, trauma, and wreckage - on scales both grand and intimate - are quietly, powerfully delivered. Excellent character development, set pieces, and effects. I can't really imagine a Godzilla movie possibly being better than this.",

    "text": "All of them should've been eaten, especially Lindy (Ricky was probably the only one worth saving)<br /><br />I don't think it was explained why the slugs and the dot wants to kill them in alphabetical order  but that doesn't matter because they were the ture heroes<br /><br />This episode written by Russell T Davies was pretty decent and interesting to have a Doctor and Companion-Lite episode, making them try to save someone from afar. I also did like the social commentary of white, rich and privileged kids being ignorant to the world around them<br /><br />Absolutely love Ncuti's performance as The Doctor experiencing racism towards him for the first time, that last scene really elevated the episode for me and gets a half a star, also really like Murray Gold's music during the scene <br /><br />Really like The Doctor and Ruby finally noticing the lady and my crazy theory is that the lady is his granddaughter, Susan, and Ruby is her daughter",
